# Automated Perceptual Maps for Brands with Social Media Data

Imagine if you were a major brand like Marvel's Avengers and are doing market perception fresearch on what differentiates your brand of superhero movies from those of a competitor, like DC Comics. Where would you start? 

The current state of the industry is one of trial-and-error, whereby marketers make a guess at what attributes consumers look for in their products and subsequently spend millions of dollars in research on confirmatory analysis on their guesses. We propose a more unsupervised and efficient approach to doing perpetual mapping. 

This project aims to use Natural Language Processing techniques to mine sentiment and key attributes from information present in publicly available Consumer Review and Social Media data. 

The goal is to solve a yet unsolved, marketing analytics problem and extract information that can drive business insights on consumer perception, and ultimately, business value for institutional customers. 

An optimistic outcome of this project would be to produce an end-to-end framework that takes in Initial Attributes and Product Category and produces comprehensive Brand Attribute Maps.
